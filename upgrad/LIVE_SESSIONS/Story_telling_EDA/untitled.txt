###### Visualize the correlation between the number of missing values in different columns as a heatmap

- A value near -1 means if one variable appears then the other variable is very likely to be missing.
- A value near 0 means there is no dependence between the occurrence of missing values of two variables.
- A value near 1 means if one variable appears then the other variable is very likely to be present.


* Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the central point.

* Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.


- If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical
- If the skewness is between -1 and â€” 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed
- If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed


* If the distribution is tall and thin it is called a leptokurtic distribution(Kurtosis > 3). Values in a leptokurtic distribution are near the mean or at the extremes.
* A flat distribution where the values are moderately spread out (i.e., unlike leptokurtic) is called platykurtic(Kurtosis <3) distribution.
* A distribution whose shape is in between a leptokurtic distribution and a platykurtic distribution is called a mesokurtic(Kurtosis=3) distribution. A mesokurtic distribution looks more close to a normal distribution.





- High kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has heavy outliers.
- Low kurtosis in a data set is an indicator that data has lack of outliers.
