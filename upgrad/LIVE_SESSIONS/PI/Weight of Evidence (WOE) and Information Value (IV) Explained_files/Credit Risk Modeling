Monthly instalments are generally same every month throughout term if interest and term is not changed. Sometimes bank restructures loan portfolio and reduce interest rate but increase terms (i.e. number of years you need to pay monthly instalments) so monthly instalment gets changed.   \u003Ch3 style=\"margin-top:1em;\"\u003EHow much principal and interest in each instalment?\u003C\/h3\u003EWe generally pay high interest rate initially and it goes down after that in successive months. It is because it depends on loan balance. Once you pay first monthly instalment, your loan balance goes down from original loan amount (i.e origination loan amount) to (original loan amount - principal amount you paid in first instalment). \u003Cp\u003EPrincipal part in instalment goes up every month. In other words, Principal amount increases in following months. Since instalment is summation of principal and interest amount, when principal amount goes up, interest goes down to balance out. \u003C\/p\u003E \u003Cb\u003EExample :\u003C\/b\u003E You took a personal loan of 50,000 over a period of 6 years at 8.5% per annum paid monthly (12 payments per year)\u003Cbr\u003EThe table below shows amortisation schedule of first year.

Vintage analysis is also called 'cohort' analysis.  \u003Ch2 style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"\u003EIntroduction to Vintage Analysis\u003C\/h2\u003EIn credit risk, it is a popular method for managing credit risk. The term 'Vintage' refers to the month or quarter in which account was opened (loan was granted). In simple words, the vintage analysis measures the performance of a portfolio in different periods of time after the loan (or credit card) was granted. Performance can be measured in the form of cumulative charge-off rate, proportion of customers 30\/60\/90 days past due (DPD), utilization ratio, average balance etc. \u003Cp\u003EThe vintage analysis is used for a variety of purposes. Some of them are listed below - \u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIdentify if accounts opened in a particular month or quarter are riskier than others\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDetermine the optimal period of performance window in development of scorecard\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMonitor or track risk of a portfolio\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEstimate minimum months required after that we can cross-sell to new customers\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EForecast risk\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECan be used in stress testing\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2 style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"\u003EHow Vintage Analysis is used in credit risk modeling?\u003C\/h2\u003EIt is used to determine the number of months' data you should consider for performance window. If customer defaults (90 days or more past due) during the performance window, borrower would be considered as a 'bad' customer and labeled as 'event' in dependent variable. \u003Cp\u003ETo do this process, we first need to take multiple periods. Let's take 6 different time periods for demonstration - \u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E36 months window starting from Q1,2016. Q1,2016 is the period when accounts were opened and we would see their performance in the next 36 months.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E30 months window starting from Q3,2016. Why 30 months? For accounts opened in 3rd quarter of 2016, we only have 30 months of data.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E24 months window starting from Q1,2017\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E18 months window starting from Q3,2017\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E12 months window starting from Q1,2018\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E6  months window starting from Q3,2018\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ol\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E \u003Cb\u003ENext step\u003C\/b\u003E is to calculate the cumulative % of bad customers or cumulative charge-off rate (also known as cumulative loss rate) against months on books (MOB) which is the number of months that have completed since the loan origination Date.

Sometimes customers pay some installments of loan but don\u0026#39;t repay the full amount which includes principal amount plus interest. For example, you took a personal loan of USD 100,000 for 10 years at 9% interest rate. You paid a few initial installments of loan to the bank but stopped paying afterwards. Remaining unpaid installments are worth USD 30,000. It\u0026#39;s a loss to the bank. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#39;s not restricted to retail customers but includes small, medium and big corporate houses. In news, you might have heard of Kingfisher Company became non-performing asset (NPA) which means the company had not been able to pay dues. High NPAs lead to huge financial losses to the bank which turns to reduction of interest rate on the deposit into banks. Serious honest borrowers with good credit history (credit score) would have to suffer. Hence it is essential that banks have sufficient capital to protect depositors from risks\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-JwgWZ6N_A0o\/XWbLBLlTBQI\/AAAAAAAAIDM\/8HdB-1Qpo2IZXP-zTYxb4EpXZ4XmrBUkQCLcBGAs\/s1600\/credit%2Brisk%2Bmodeling.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"Introduction to Credit Risk Analytics\" img border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-JwgWZ6N_A0o\/XWbLBLlTBQI\/AAAAAAAAIDM\/8HdB-1Qpo2IZXP-zTYxb4EpXZ4XmrBUkQCLcBGAs\/s1600\/credit%2Brisk%2Bmodeling.PNG\" data-original-width=\"529\" data-original-height=\"281\"\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ch2 style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"\u003EWhy Credit Risk is important?\u003C\/h2\u003EDo you remember or aware of 2008 recession? In US, mortgage home loan were given to low creditworthy customers (individuals with poor credit score). Poor credit score indicates that one is highly likely to default on loan which means they are risky customers for bank. To compensate risk, banks used to charge higher interest rate than the normal standard rate. Banks funded these loans by selling them to investors on the secondary market. The process of selling them to investors is a legal financial method which is called \u003Ccode\u003ECollateralized debt obligations (CDO)\u003C\/code\u003E. In 2004-2007, these CDOs were considered as low-risky financial instrument (highly rated).  \u003Cp\u003EAs these home loan borrowers had high chance to default, many of the them started defaulting on their loans and banks started seizing (foreclose) their property. The real estate bubble burst and a sharp decline in home prices. Many financial institutions globally invested in these funds resulted to a recession. Banks, investors and re-insurers faced huge financial losses and bankruptcy of many financial and non-financial firms. Even non-financial firms were impacted badly because of either their investment in these funds or impacted because of a very low demand and purchasing activities in the economy. In simple words, people had a very little or no money to spend which leads to many organisations halted their production. It further leads to huge job losses. US Government bailed out many big corporate houses during recession. You may have understood now why credit risk is so important. The whole economy can be in danger if current and future credit losses are not identified or estimated properly.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.listendata.com\/2019\/08\/credit-risk-modelling.html#more\"\u003EREAD MORE »\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.listendata.com\/feeds\/1103545347747440817\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/www.listendata.com\/2019\/08\/credit-risk-modelling.html#comment-form","title":"34 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7958828565254404797\/posts\/default\/1103545347747440817"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7958828565254404797\/posts\/default\/1103545347747440817"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/www.listendata.com\/2019\/08\/credit-risk-modelling.html","title":"A Complete Guide to Credit Risk Modelling"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Deepanshu Bhalla"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/09802839558125192674"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-PqC2AJwETCk\/YbSzTQpmhPI\/AAAAAAAANDU\/r0aDGTVySlEYgYNScdZK2B8hyUW-1mIhQCK4BGAYYCw\/s100\/pic.jpg"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-JwgWZ6N_A0o\/XWbLBLlTBQI\/AAAAAAAAIDM\/8HdB-1Qpo2IZXP-zTYxb4EpXZ4XmrBUkQCLcBGAs\/s72-c\/credit%2Brisk%2Bmodeling.PNG","height":"72","width":"72"},"thr$total":{"$t":"34"}}]}});
