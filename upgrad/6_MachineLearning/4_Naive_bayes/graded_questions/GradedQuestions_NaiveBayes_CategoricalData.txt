1. What is the prior probability of a mail being spam, P(class = spam)? - 7/15
2. What does Naive Bayes assume while classifying spam or ham mails?
	That frequency of keywords like hurry, free, offer etc. are conditionally independent of each other
3. Consider an email with the vector of features X = (free, data, weekend, click). What is the likelihood, P(X | spam)? - 4/ 2401
4. Consider an email with the vector of features X = (free, data, weekend, click). What is the likelihood, P(X | ham)? - 2/4096
5. The value of P(X|Class). P(Class) for class = spam for X = (free, data, weekend, click)?  - (4/2401)(7/15)
6. What is the posterior for class = ham (i.e. without division by denominator) for the feature vector  X = (free, data, weekend, click)? (2/4096)(8/15)
7. Which class should be point X = (free, data, weekend, click) be classified into? - Spam



1. What is the accuracy of the model? - 940/1000
2. What is the sensitivity of the model? - 440 / 480
3. What is the specificity of the model? - 500 / 520
4. Given that you do not want to misclassify any genuine emails, which metric should be as high as possible? - Specificity
